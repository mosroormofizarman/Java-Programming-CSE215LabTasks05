1. Write a method countVowels(String arg) that takes a String as parameter and returns the
number of vowels.


2. Write a method isPalidrome(String arg) that determines if a String is palindrome or not.
Palindrome is when a String remains the same after reversing. The method should return boolean
type.
For example: MADAM is palindrome.


3. Write a program that has the following static variable - balance (initial value 0) and these
static methods:
deposit(double amount): Increase account balance
withdraw(double amount): Decrease account balance
Now run an infinite loop in main program so it displays user with following options:
1. Deposit
2. Withdraw
3. Balance
4. Exit
Under each option, the program should ask for appropriate user input (i.e. amount to deposit).
